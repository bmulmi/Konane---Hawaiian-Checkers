3/14/2018:
- generated the dynamic board array. 0.5 Hrs
- added AlertDialogue when new game is pressed, has option for board dimension. 0.5 Hrs
- generated rowsLabel, columnsLabel and konaneLayout Dynamically. 2 Hrs

3/15/2018:
- added alphaBetaPruning checkbox option. 0.5 Hrs
- added plyCutoff option with editText widget and a go button. 1 Hr
- added BoardDimension to Serialized File. 0.5 Hrs
- successfully saves and loads game. 0.5 Hrs

3/16/2018:
- added private boolean computerPlays to the player class to set the stone's player as computer(true) or human(false)
- worked on DFS, to get all the possible moves. 1Hr
- Introduced a new object class Move that stores the row, col coordinates of the Move, its current score, and its parent move. 1 Hr

3/17/2018:
- Modified DFS. Stored the Moves as Pair<source, destination> in Vector. 3 Hrs
- worked on getting the path from the source the destination. 2.5 Hrs

3/18/2018:
- worked on making the move from the moves received from DFS by using the getPath function. Just needed to pass the board array into the previous makeMove function. 1 Hr
- generated the algorithm of MiniMax. 3.5 Hrs
- Coded the Minimax algorith. Failed. 3 Hrs

3/19/2018:
- Found the bug in minimax, was passing board array with the same reference. Introduced a function to copy the string array so that the original board would not be modified. 1Hr
- Changed parts of code where Move objects were referenced as same objects. Introduced a new public function in Move class that clones the Move. 2.5 Hrs
- Worked on MiniMax Algorithm. Worked! 3 Hrs
- Added getAlgorithmTime function to get the algorithm time. 0.5 Hr

3/21/2018:
- Added Alpha Beta Pruning into MiniMax Algorithm. 1 Hr
- Worked on storing the total scores of the maximizer and minimizer in the path that Minimax followed. 2 Hrs
- Worked on exiting the app once saved button is pressed. 1 Hr

3/22/2018:
- Worked on getting the scores of maximizer and minimizer from the path returned by the MiniMax algorithm. Passed maximizer's and minimizer's scores into the recursive function. Did not work. 3 Hrs
- Created a new class Child that would keep the record of the best child of a move, along with the maximizer's and minimizer's scores. Algorithm runs successfully. 2.5 Hrs

3/23/2018:
- Found a bug. Null object returned after calling minimax some while later. Fixed. 0.5 Hrs
- DFS was not working correctly. Re-coded the DFS function. Successful. 3 Hrs
